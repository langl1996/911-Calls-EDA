In this project, I will analyze some data about 911 emergency calls: Fire, Traffic, EMS for Montgomery County, PA. I will study the patterns and get more insights from the dataset.There are 423909 observations and 9 columns in the dataset, which includes Latitude, Longitude, Description of the Emergency Call, Zipcode, Title, TimeStamp: YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM:SS, Township, Address, and a dummy variable ‘e’ (always 1).
Question of Interest: 1) Analyze geographical characteristics of the 911 calls 2) Analyze the relationship between the frequency of calls and time period. 3) Analyze reasons of 911 calls. (i.e. the relationship between reasons and time, reasons and geographical region) In the following part, I will inspect the data structure, make analysis, show visualizations, and state our main findings.
